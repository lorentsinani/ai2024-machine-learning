# ai2024-machine-learning

This repository is mainly focused to fulfill these requirements for the 2 datasets topics choosen:
- Address missing values,
- Do pre-processing,
- Implement all three algorithms: LightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost for two datasets topics,
- Compare results of: LightGBM vs XGBoost vs CatBoost.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of LightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost algorithms for predicting results in python. Here are 2 datasets used for this project:
- [Board Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/board-games/)
