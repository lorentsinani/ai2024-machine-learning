# ai2024-machine-learning

This repository is mainly focused to fulfill these requirements for the 2 datasets topics choosen:
- Address missing values,
- Do pre-processing,
- Implement all three algorithms: LightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost for two datasets topics,
- Compare results of: LightGBM vs XGBoost vs CatBoost.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of LightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost algorithms for predicting results in python. Here are 2 datasets used for this project:
- [Board Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/board-games/)
- [Spotify and Youtube](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube/) 

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lorentsinani/ai2024-machine-learning.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd ai2024-machine0learning
    ```

3. Run the project in notebook using `jupyter notebook` which you need to install(if it's not):

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
  OR navigate to  Spotify and Youtube dataset directory `./SpotifyAndYoutube/src/` and run the `main.py` via python like:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

4. The project will displayed in `jupyter` localhost where you can run cells and check results.
